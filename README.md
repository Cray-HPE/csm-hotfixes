# CSM Hotfixes

This repo. contains hotfixes which are individually packaged and made available
to customers. Changes are built and uploaded per folder as the .version file in
each directory is changed.

The resulting artifact becomes available at `https://storage.googleapis.com/csm-release-public/hotfix/<release>.tar.gz`

## Hotfix Distributions

Run `./release.sh <hotfix>` to generate a distribution for the specified
hotfix.

## Hotfix Directory Structure

Each hotfix directory is expected to contain asset indexes and scripts for
applying the hotfix. The following files are used by `release.sh` to generate
hotfix distributions:

  - `lib/version.sh`: Script generated by the `gen-version-sh` utility in
    `vendor/stash.us.cray.com/scm/shastarelm/release/lib/release.sh`. Use
    `update-version.sh` to properly update the version number in this script. 
    > Note: The build pipeline will only build versions that do not exist in the
      GCP hotfix bucket.
  - `docker/index.yaml`: An optional docker index.yaml file that'll be
    used to skopeo sync docker images to the hotfix's release
  - `docker/transform.sh`: An optional script to fixup container image
    repositories
  - `helm/index.yaml`: An optional helm index.yaml file that contains
    a list of helm charts to be added to the hotfix's release

## Hotfix Usage (`install-hotfix.sh`)

Every `install-hotfix.sh` script 

```bash
ROOTDIR=$(dirname $0)
source "${ROOTDIR}/lib/version.sh"
${ROOTDIR}/lib/setup-nexus.sh
```

Including those lines at the head of the hotfix will ensure the right libraries and setup is done.

### Hotfix - Including RPMs

To include RPMs in your hotfix, please add them to the CSM repository to the respective YAML files
( compute or non-compute ):
- GitHub: https://github.com/Cray-HPE/csm/tree/main/rpm/cray/csm
- Stash (legacy): https://stash.us.cray.com/projects/CSM


#### Conventions:

  - `README.md`: Hotfix documentation; how to apply the hotfix, and any details.
  - `lib/setup-nexus.sh`: Script for populating Nexus Repositories with any artifacts the hotfix needs; helm charts, rpms, docker images, and etc.
  - `lib/install.sh`: (boilerplate) A dependency for `setup-nexus.sh`, enabling the uploadTypically a symlink to the `lib/install.sh` library from
    the vendored SHASTARELM/release repo which is used by `lib/setup-nexus.sh`.
  - `install-hotfix.sh`: Applies the hotfix. (if dependencies are needed for a hotfix, then this runs after `setup-nexus.sh`)

## Hotfix Usage

Typically, for a hotfix with dependencies (helm charts, docker images, or RPMs) the execution order
for a user would be:
- `lib/setup-nexus.sh`
- `lib/install.sh`

For hotfixes without dependencies, `lib/install.sh` is all that is required.
